1. Users can confirm their email
2. How can I make it so I can't see who signs up? 
3. The website will be just a bunch of posts from anonymous or named users looking for someone with similar interest, each post will have a title, subtitle and paragraph
4. First let's think about not being anonymous and then we can think about the harder anonymous part, lets just connect people right now
5. Someone would have their post and they could have a profile and another user would click on their post and then there would be a button to message the user 

6. Okay simple: have account, make post, be able to message
